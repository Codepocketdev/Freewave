# 🎵 FreeWave  
**A Nostr-Based Open Music Player**

FreeWave is a lightweight, open-source Nostr music player that listens for song commands sent through Nostr relays — then automatically plays and manages them locally.  
It’s built for freedom, experimentation, and creativity — turning simple code into a distributed jukebox that anyone can extend, test, or remix.

---

## ✨ Features

- 📡 Listens to Nostr relays for song commands  
- 🎶 Downloads and plays songs automatically using `yt-dlp` and `mpv`  
- 🧠 Caches songs locally for faster playback  
- 🔒 Uses exported private keys (no need to store keys inside the code)  
- 🧩 Open-source, easy to extend, and community-driven  
- 💡 Optional hardware integration — LED lights, displays, and buttons

## 🧠 How It Works

FreeWave listens for Nostr events that start with a prefix like:

PLAY_SONG: <song name>

Once received, it automatically:
1. Finds the song on YouTube.  
2. Downloads it as an MP3 using `yt-dlp`.  
3. Plays it locally using `mpv`.  
4. Deletes it after playback to save space.  

It’s simple, transparent, and totally open.

## ⚙️ Requirements

Before running FreeWave, make sure you have:

- **Node.js v18+**
- **npm**
- **yt-dlp** (YouTube downloader)
- **mpv** (audio player)
- **Internet connection**
- *(Optional)* `pm2` for background running

## 📦 Installation Guide

### 1️⃣ Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/FreeWave.git
cd FreeWave

2️⃣ Install Dependencies

npm install

3️⃣ Install System Tools

Ubuntu / Debian

sudo apt update
sudo apt install mpv
pip install yt-dlp

macOS

brew install mpv yt-dlp

Windows

Install Node.js from nodejs.org

Download yt-dlp.exe and mpv.exe, and add both to PATH

🔑 Exporting Your Keys

To protect privacy, FreeWave never stores your keys directly inside the script.
Instead, export them as environment variables.

Example:

export NOSTR_PRIVKEY_HEX="your_private_key_here"

If you only have an nsec key, you can convert it to hex:

node
> const { nip19 } = await import("nostr-tools");
> const result = nip19.decode("nsec1yourkeyhere");
> console.log(Buffer.from(result.data).toString("hex"));

Then export the result again:

export NOSTR_PRIVKEY_HEX="converted_hex_key_here"

Now your scripts can access it automatically!


---

🚀 Usage

Send a Song Command

npm run send-song "Blinding Lights by The Weeknd"

Start the Listener

npm run start-listener

FreeWave will automatically detect your Nostr commands, download, play, and clean up after itself.

🧰 Gadgets & Hardware Setup (Optional)

You can go beyond the terminal — build your own FreeWave Node!

Gadget	Purpose / Use

💻 Old Android Phone	Run FreeWave via Termux or Node.js as a portable Nostr node
🥧 Raspberry Pi (3 or 4)	24/7 listener connected to a speaker or display
⚙️ Arduino (ESP32 / ESP8266)	Control LEDs, buttons, or visual indicators
🧠 OLED / LCD Display	Show current track name, artist, or connection status
🔊 Bluetooth Speaker	Wireless music playback
🔵 RGB LEDs or Neopixels	Flash, pulse, or animate with the beat
🧩 Powerbank or UPS	Run your setup off-grid
🌐 WiFi Dongle / Ethernet	Ensure a stable connection
🎛️ Buttons / Rotary Knob	Control play, pause, or skip directly
🔈 Mini Amplifier (PAM8403)	Boost small speaker setups
🪶 3D-Printed Case	Make your node look like a futuristic jukebox

🧠 How to Make It Interactive

Want to bring your FreeWave to life?

Use an ESP32 board to detect song events and light up LEDs.

Add an OLED display to show track titles and relay names.

Control playback with buttons using simple serial commands.


Your FreeWave becomes a smart, physical music player powered by Nostr!

Would you like me to add a **DIY Hardware Build section** next (wiring + commands for ESP32 + LED effects when a song plays)?  
That would turn FreeWave into a complete open hardware + software ecosystem.
